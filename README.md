## 🐦‍⬛ Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for rivelin_extra, a collection of open source crates developed for the Rivelin Project. The Rivelin Project is a cloud container building service written in Rust. It's currently under development and primarily exists as a learning project and maybe to help me get a job.

### 📦 Crates

The following crates are included in this repository:

- [rivelin_actors](rivelin_actors): A tokio based actor framework. Includes some actor implementations including a pub/sub event bus.

- [rivelin_packit](rivelin_packit): Coming soon... A WASM based OCI compliant image builder. Inspired by [nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com/docs/getting-started) and [buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/).

### Developing

To run all tests cd into a crate and run:

```sh
cargo test
```

📖 To build the docs run:

```sh
cargo doc --open
```
